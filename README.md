# Prediction-with-Binomial-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to predict whether a bank client will subscribe to a term deposit using logistic regression, based on the Bank Marketing dataset.
The predictive model developed for the Bank Marketing dataset provides valuable insights into customer behavior and the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.
Logistic Regression was used due to the binary nature of the target (yes/no).

Important features influencing subscription decisions include:
duration of the call,
customer's balance,
poutcome (previous campaign outcome),
job type, and month.

**BUSINESS IMPACT**
This model helps in targeted marketing, focusing on clients more likely to subscribe.

The lead scoring table allows the marketing team to prioritize high-probability clients, improving conversion rates and optimizing resources.
